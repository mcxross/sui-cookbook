# Data retrieval

The SDK provides a robust abstraction for fetching Sui network data like `Transactions`, `Checkpoints`, `Objects`, `Events`, 
and more through the available interfaces.

Currently, only the **GraphQL** interface is supported. However, support for **gRPC** is planned and will be added in a future update.
